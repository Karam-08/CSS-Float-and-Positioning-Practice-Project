        Three ways to Start:
     </h2>
    <p> 
        In order to not end up like the Dog on the right, you will need to improve your looks. Improving yourself takes time and dedication, and there are many ways to do so. This is called Looksmaxing (or Looksmaxxing), and I will show you how to start.
    </p>
    <p>
        One way to start Looksmaxxing is to start Mewing. Mewing is the act of resting your tongue on the roof of your mouth and applying pressure. 
        This aims to change the structure of your jaw by making it more strong and chiseled. Having a strong and chiseled jawline automatically makes you more confident about your appearance.
        It also indicates good health and gives you a better smile, which makes you more attractive to others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another way to start Looksmaxxing is to do Skincare. You should start with a cleanser, moisturizer, and a sunscreen recommended by dermatologists.
        Your face is the canvas upon which your style is projected. Skincare has so many benefits and cannot be ignored if you are trying to improve yourself.
        Just to name three benefits, Skincare can prevent skin problems, boost confidence, and most importantly, it can make you look more youthful.
    </p>
    <p>
        My last tip to start Looksmaxxing is to change your diet. You want a diet that is high in Protein and other Nutrients. Remove processed foods from your diet.
        Eating foods high in Protein can help you gain muscle. Muscles are attractive because they are a symbol of strength, health, and fitness.
        Nutritional food is good for your health in general. It can lower your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer.
        Processed foods are bad for you because they have high amounts of fat, salt, and sugar. High amounts of these can make you gain weight and make you fat, which is not what you want when Looksmaxxing.
